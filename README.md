The following four examples are available (and pull requests are always welcome!):
- **Node/Javscript**
  - [*using airtable.js*](javascript/using_airtable.js/), Airtable's first party Javascript SDK
  - [*using node-fetch*](javascript/using_node-fetch/), for times when you need to use minimal external dependencies
  - [*using Airtable Scripting Apps*](javascript/using_airtable-scripting/), when you want Airtable to host your Javascript code alongside your base
- **Python**
  - [*using pyairtable*](python/using_pyairtable/) (a community supported Airtable SDK)
