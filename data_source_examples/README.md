This sub folder (`data_source_examples`) includes data source specific upsert examples.

If you don't see an example for your data source or are looking for data source agnostic examples, visit out our top-level [README.md here](../README.md) which has a list of generic examples.

There are currently three data source specific upsert examples available:

- [**PostrgeSQL database**](postgresql/using_airtable.js/) - import rows from multiple PostgreSQL tables into an Airtable base while maintaining relationships
- [**Slack Conversation History**](slack_conversation_history/using_airtable.js/) - bring messages from a Slack channel into a single Airtable table
- [**Workday Reports**](workday) - leverage Workday's RaaS (reporting as a service) functionality to export data from Workday and import it into Airtable
