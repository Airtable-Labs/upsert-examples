EngineerU brand identity,Brand identity,True,EngineerU,2020-10-06,2020-10-20,"EngineerU's popularity is only growing. In the first week following its launch in 2015, the website attracted an incredible 300,000 users, which has grown to encompass over 20 million programmers and coders today. EngineerU's user base represents an expansive demographic, with strong gender parity and users from all generations—a remarkable feat in the typically young, male tech industry.


EngineerU's new brand identity is inspired by the website's impressively diverse user base, with a simplified visual package that can take on many colors, designs, and forms, but with the website's core design principles and logo remaining consistent. This represents not only the website's wide demographic, but also its many uses, from training to collaboration. "
